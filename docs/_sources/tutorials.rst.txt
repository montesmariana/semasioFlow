Tutorials
=========

The semasioFlow package is designed to facilitate a specific workflow
creating multiple token-level distance matrices and useful registers
based on ``nephosem`` package. For ``nephosem`` tutorials go
`here <https://qlvl.github.io/nephosem/tutorials.html>`_. 

The basic workflow based on a single lemma can be found :doc:`here <tutorials/createClouds>`,
which includes output.
In order to run the code, **replace the paths to the cloned repositories with your own**.
See :doc:`usage` for an example.

After going through this workflow, you can move on to `the R code <https://montesmariana.github.io/semcloud/articles/processClouds.html>`_.
