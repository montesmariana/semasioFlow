This is a Python module in development.
It builds on the [nephosem](https://qlvl.github.io/nephosem/) package
and adds functions to create token-level vector space models in a semasiological workflow
like the one followed [here](https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me/).

The documentation is available [here](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow).

If you use the code here, please report success/failures in the [Issues](https://github.com/montesmariana/semasioFlow/issues).
