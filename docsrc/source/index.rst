Welcome to semasioFlow's documentation!
=======================================

This Python package builds on `nephosem <https://qlvl.github.io/nephosem>`_ to facilitate
building multiple token-level distributional models based on different combinations
of parameter settings, as done `here <https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me/>`_.

The output from the workflow suggested here can then be processed with functions
from the `semcloud <https://montesmariana.github.io/semcloud>`_ R package to then
be visualized with `NephoVis <https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis/>`_ or
`this Shiny App <https://marianamontes.shinyapps.io/Level3/>`_.
